I’m a product designer who codes, with a focus on design systems, dedicated to preserving design integrity by pushing technical boundaries. I think in systems *and* sweat the details.

With a deep understanding of both design and development, I’m able to be flexible and efficient. I make informed, balanced decisions within the constraints of both disciplines, bridge communication between teams, and thrive during every stage of a project.

If you have a position or a project that I'd be suitable for, then please get in touch.

Iâ€™m a multi-disciplinary designer that specialises in user interface and design systems, with a keen interest in pushing technical limits to preserve design integrity.

I have a deep understanding of design and development that enables me to be flexible and efficient. I make informed, balanced decisions within the constraints of both disciplines, bridge communication between teams, and thrive during delivery across several stages of a project.

If you have a position or a project that I'd be suitable for, then please get in touch.

I am an experienced, full-stack designer that specialises in user interface and design systems. I love challenging perceptions around what is technically possible if it'll preserve a design's integrity.

My in-depth understanding of design and development allow me to be flexible and effective. I can take part during any stage of a project, expedite better communication between teams, and make informed decisions that consider the constraints of both disciplines.

If you have a position or a project that I'd be suitable for, then please get in touch.

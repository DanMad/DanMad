I am an experienced, full-stack designer that specialises in UI design and design systems. I enjoy challenging the notion of what’s technically feasible when it will benefit a design’s integrity.

I have an in-depth understanding of design and development that allows me to be flexible and effective. I can take part during any stage of a project, expedite better communication between teams, and make informed decisions that consider the constraints of both disciplines.

If you have a position or a project that I'd be suitable for, then please get in touch.
